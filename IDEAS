microlibs: Small, one-file libs

Problem: Annoying to manage with seperate repos, versions, setup.py, etc
Lots of overhead and boilerplate.

Idea for a utility to manage them
Takes the form of a managed git repo

Each lib -> a file in root dir
All info on a lib is contained in file:
	* licence
	* description
	* author
	etc (all optional)
Given as eg. __AUTHOR__ or pulled from docstring for description
Name is file name.

microlib build -> creates a build dir with full package layout, ie
build/
 lib name/
  setup.py
  libname.py
  LICENCE
  README (from docstring)

Commands:
microlib build [NAME] - create/update build dir with libs (or specific lib)
microlib setup[.py] NAME {ARGS} - run setup.py for given lib with given args, or all if NAME == "all"
microlib list - list libs found in this repo

TODO: LICENCE and README files
